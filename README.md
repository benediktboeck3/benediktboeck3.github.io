#### Description:

Hello everyone!

my name is Benedikt and for my Final Project of the CS50x course I created a Homepage with GitHub pages. Where you view food recipes, I cooked
quite often. The plan is to share the page with my friends and anyone who is interested. If I want to add some new recipes, I can use the same
adjusted bootstrap component.
Further since I always wanted to review restaurants, a page with restaurant reviews is also planned.
At the moment, the page contains three recipes, and you can access the recipes in three languages, English, German and Spanish. To access the
different languages you click on the flags in the right corner. Every recipe has three items, Ingredients, Steps and Tips. Moreover, you can
collapse the recipe steps if you want to print one example specifically, there is also a link to my Instagram account,
where I post dishes I cooked. It also possible to change the text size of the recipes with a select button.
Since IÂ´m thinking about taking the Web Programming track there will be maybe more features soon. All the pictures I used on
my page are from Creative Commons <https://creativecommons.org/>.
If you have questions or improvement suggestions feel free to contact me at benediktboeck@gmail.com.

### Files:
### index.html
- The start page of my website. You see flags to change the language and links to the review page and my Instagram account. If you scroll down, you see the different recipes.
- The accordions are from <https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/accordion/>. I adjusted the code that only the clicked windows close, and all windows are by default open.

### ger.html
- The start page in German. The buildup is identical to the English page. If you want to see the content in another Language click on the flag.

### esp.html
- The start page in Spanish. The buildup is identical to the English page.

### review.html
- This will be my review page. Right now there is only a photo of a cat which says "No reviews yet".

### styles.css
- My CSS file, where I collected my style properties of my page. The base data was from the "Lab 8".

## jpg's
- that are all the pictures I used. Hence the flags, the food pictures and the cat. Every one of them is from Creative Commons.
