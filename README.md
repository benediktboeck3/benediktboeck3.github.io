Hello everyone!

my name is Benedikt and for my Final Project of the CS50x course I created a Homepage of my most used recipes which I can share with my
friends and anyone who is interested. Further since I always wanted to review restaurants, a page with restaurant reviews is also planned.
At the moment, the page contains three recipes, and you can access the recipes in three languages, English, German and Spanish. To access the
different languages you click on the flags in the right corner. Moreover, you can collapse the recipe steps if you want to print one example
specifically, there is also a link to my Instagram account, where I post dishes I cooked, and it is possible to change the text size
of the recipes with a select button.
Since IÂ´m thinking about taking the Web Programming track there will be maybe more features soon. All the pictures I used on
my page are from Creative Commons <https://creativecommons.org/>.
If you have questions or improvement suggestions feel free to contact me at benediktboeck@gmail.com.
